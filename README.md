## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python from CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m applying to MLSA (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors).

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m not currently working on anything special.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a student eager to learn new stuff and get better at what I know at the moment.
